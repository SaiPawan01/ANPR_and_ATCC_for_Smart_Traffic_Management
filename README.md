# ANPR and ATCC for Smart Traffic Management



## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on **automatic number plate recognition (ANPR)** and **traffic counting & classification** using computer vision and deep learning techniques. It is designed to detect, recognize, and classify vehicles from live video feeds or images, making it ideal for traffic monitoring, toll collection, and smart city applications.

## 📌 Features

- **License Plate Detection & Recognition**: Extracts vehicle number plates and reads characters using OCR.
- **Vehicle Counting**: Counts vehicles passing through a designated area in real-time.
- **Traffic Classification**: Categorizes vehicles into different types (e.g., cars, trucks, motorcycles).
- **Real-time Processing**: Supports real-time video streams from cameras.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Object Detection Model**: YOLO (You Only Look Once) / SSD
- **OCR Engine**: Tesseract OCR
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
